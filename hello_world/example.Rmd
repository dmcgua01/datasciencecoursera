This is a simple R markdown file
This is *italic*, and this is **bold**.

Note that lists need at least one space between the first element and the previous line

This is an ordered list:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
1. item 1
2. item 2
    + Item 2a (note that 4 spaces are required to indent one level)
    + Item 2b
3. item 3

This is an unordered list (each of these are equivalent bullet points):

* item 1
- item 2
+ item 3

Inline code is used with backticks: `puts 'Hello World!'`, like so!

This is a code block:
```
x = 1
y = 2

puts x + y
```

> This is a blockquote
